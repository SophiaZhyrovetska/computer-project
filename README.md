<p>
CS@UCU first-year project for Discrete Mathematics, which gives you an opportunity to discover one of most important field of discrete math - graphs</p>
<h2>What You Can Do:</h2>
<h3>1. Visualize your graph</h3>
<h3>2. Different types of matrixes(matrix of incidence, adjacency matrix)</h3>
<h3>3. Faster and Greater Hamiltonian and Euler cycles</h3>
<h3>4. MORE - SOON</h3>



<p>
How to use:<br>1. Enter the edges of your graph and remember to follow the instructions
<br>2. Enjoy and observe the visualized graph
<br>3. See the features of the graph
